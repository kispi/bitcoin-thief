# Bitcoin Thief

Code is absolutely simple. Do whatever you want to do.

## Run

Just install and run.

```
npm install
node thief.js
```

## Caveat
You'd better run a [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/ko/download) full node in order to make this program faster, since this uses RPC call to localhost by default and it's much faster than check another nodes (in distance) to check the balance for given address.
